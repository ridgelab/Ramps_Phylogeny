The directory "IdentifyRamps" contains all scripts and data used to identify ramps from dataset.

The directory "PresenceAbsencePhylogenies" contains all scripts and data used to create phylogenies using
the presence and absence of ramp sequences.

The directory "RampRetentionIndices" contains all scripts and data used to calculate the retention index for ramp sequences,
and it also contains the scripts for doing the permutations analysis.

The directory "ShortenedSequenceAnalysis" contains all scripts and data used to perform the control where the first 50 codons
are removed from all genes.
